                    Kriya Yoga is a spiritual practice that incorporates meditation, breath control, and specific techniques
                    to facilitate spiritual growth and self-realization. It is rooted in the ancient yogic teachings of India
                    and has been popularized by various spiritual teachers and organizations, most notably by Paramahansa
                    Yogananda and his book "Autobiography of a Yogi."

                    <br><br>
                    Kriya Yoga is considered a comprehensive and advanced yogic practice, aiming to harmonize the body, mind,
                    and soul. The word "kriya" means action or movement, indicating the transformative actions performed during
                    the practice.
                    <br><br>
                    The core principles and techniques of Kriya Yoga involve:<br><br>

                    1. Pranayama: Breath control exercises are practiced to regulate and direct the life force energy (prana)
                    within the body. This includes various breathing techniques, such as rhythmic breathing, alternate
                    nostril breathing, and more.<br><br>

                    2. Meditation: Kriya Yoga emphasizes meditation as a means to quiet the mind, attain inner stillness, and
                    experience higher states of consciousness. Practitioners typically engage in regular meditation sessions,
                    focusing on specific techniques taught within the Kriya Yoga tradition.<br><br>

                    3. Mantra: The repetition of sacred sounds or mantras is utilized to enhance focus, purify the mind, and
                    cultivate a deeper connection with divine consciousness. Specific mantras are often assigned to practitioners
                    as part of their Kriya Yoga practice.<br><br>

                    4. Spiritual Philosophy: Kriya Yoga incorporates spiritual teachings and philosophical concepts from the yogic tradition. These teachings emphasize the unity of all existence, the pursuit of self-realization, and the recognition of the divinity within oneself and all beings.
